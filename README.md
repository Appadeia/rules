Welcome to Discord Linux

```
Glory to the Tux
Before you begin chatting away, there are a few rules that you should familiarize yourself with. Please note that these rules do not cover everything, and punishment given for reasons not listed is subjectable to staff's discretion.
If there are ever any issues with staff members, be sure to direct any and all complaints to @sans with a detailed message of what the complaint is.​
```

General Rules

```
#1 - Be respectful
This includes personal insults, demeaning behavior, and inflammatory language. Know when a debate has turned into an argument. Above all else, listen and cooperate with staff members.
​
#2 -No NSFW or illegal content
Don't post or discuss content of this nature. This includes porn, gore, pirated software, etc.
​
#3 - No spamming or irrelevant messages; English only
Sending an unreasonable amount of messages in a short time or ones that are unrelated or unwanted will result in disciplinary action. Abusing bots is considered spam. Posting large blocks of text may also be considered spam; use hastebin or paste.rs rather than posting large blocks of text in chat. This is an English only server; refrain from chatting in other languages.
​
#4 - Use the channels as intended
Please read the channel topics before using them. Likewise, if the conversation you are having is more suited to one of the specific channels, please move it there.
​
#5 - Don't link to or advertise other servers
If you want to spread the word about your server, do so elsewhere. Server invites will be deleted automatically.
​
#6 - Don't use a selfbot
They are against the terms of service and often an annoyance to other users.
​
Moderators have final say in the enforcement of these rules or other infractions.
Don't attempt to loophole or use semantics to get around these rules. Respect the intent behind them, not the literal text.
```

Punishment System

```
Restricted Words
Messages containing Discord invite links and certain restricted words will automatically be deleted by @sudobot.
Posts containing these words will result in a warning in #mod-logs.
List of restricted words
​
Verbal Warning

​
Written Warning

The user will be muted for 1 hour and have their Users role removed automatically at 8 warnings.
​
Temporary Mute
A staff member temporarily mutes the user.
​
Temporary Ban/Permanent Ban
A staff member bans the user from the server either temporarily or permanently.

Please note:
Staff members will determine the proper punishment based on the infraction.

Pinging Staff
Do not ping staff members unless you need their help. For example, if someone is spamming the server, feel free to ping @Sudoers. If you just have a question or need something else simple, ping an online staff member; not the entire @Sudoers role.
​
Users Role
In order to join roles with colors, upload files/images, embed links, use bot commands, use external emojis, and post reactions, you must have the Users role. After agreeing to the rules, the Users role will be given automatically if the user has not gotten any warnings after a 48 hour waiting period.
​
Distributions That Are Not Supported
The following distributions are not supported in Discord Linux:
Linux Mint, Solus, and any derivative of Arch Linux.
These distributions have a history of breaking important system packages and compatibility with software you install. The Discord Linux community will not offer support for any of these distributions. Feel free to use them, but please do not ask for help with them here.
See sudo distroinfo mint, sudo distroinfo solus, sudo distroinfo manjaro, sudo distroinfo antergos, and sudo tips archvariants for more info.
